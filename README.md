#### [Group Trello](https://trello.com/b/3BbMPw4j/mac-track)

## Project Scope:
The MVP of MacTrack will allow a user to generate an initial set of macronutrient targets. They will then be able to track their progress by adding foods to their day.

## Stretch Goals:
- Allow a user to tweak their macronutrient targets or change variables that will recalculate their target for them. 
- Create a page for a week view of their progress and an average for the week.
- Allow user to change entries for previous days
